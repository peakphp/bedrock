# Peak

> **Note:** This repository contains the core code of the Peak framework. If you want to build an application using Peak, visit the main [Peak repository](https://github.com/peakphp/peak).

This version is essentially a migration from class name convention like Zend Framework (ex: Library_Module_Class_Name) to PHP namespace.

This version version work with PHP 5.4 or greater. The [older version](https://github.com/1Franck/Peak) require PHP 5.2 or greater. Both version are compatible with PHP 7 but i strongly recommand to use this version. Older version is no more supported.

Old Zend database component have been dropped in favor of [Laravel/Database](https://github.com/illuminate/database) component.
