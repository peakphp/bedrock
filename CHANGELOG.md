   enableCache() and disableCache() can be used inside controller and bootstrap.
   isCached() can be used inside controller.
 - Peak_Render > Added scripts views outputing cache.
                 added methods    : enableCache(), disableCache(), preOutput(), isCached()
                 added properties : $_use_cache, $_cache_expire, $_cache_path, $_cache_id
                 Render engines must use preOutput() in their render() method instead of output() directly 
                 if they wants to support outputing cache. 
                 method output() must be protected
 - Peak_Registry > added static method isInstanceOf()
 - Peak_Lang > added method load()
 - Peak_Lang > method translate() > added translation string replacements and callback function
 - Peek_Application > fixed run(), constants ENABLE_PEAK_CONTROLLER were not properly checked. Also
   constant ENABLE_PEAK_CONTROLLER becomes ENABLE_PEAK_CONTROLLERS (now with a 'S' at the end)
 - Peak_Lang > remove property $varname and we now use return array('key' => 'translation'); in translation files 
 - CONSTANTS names change: SYSTEM_*** become LIBRARY_***, W_LANG -> APP_LANG, W_THEME -> APP_THEME, 
   W_DEFAULT_CTRL -> APP_DEFAULT_CTLR, W_LOGIN -> APP_LOGIN_NAME, W_PASS -> APP_LOGIN_PASS
 - Peak_Registry > added method get()
 - Added Peak_View_Render_Virtual
 - Peak_View > added __call() > try to look for unknow method in view engine object
   or trigger_error if method no found and DEV_MODE is true
 - Peak_Application > added support of peak internal controller if 
   constant ENABLE_PEAK_CONTROLLER exists
   internal controllers paths: /Peak/Controller/Internal/
 - Peak_View_Render > added method baseUrl(). 
 - Peak_View_Render > added magic method __call() to silent unknow methods calls
   inside views files on production environment
 - Peak_Controller > fixed E_STRICT error with method helper()
 - Peak_view > fixed E_STRICT error with method helper()
 - Peak_View > method theme() > replace deprecated function "is_a" by 
   operator "instanceof" (E_STRICT)
 - Peak_View_Theme > added method __construct() and add call to setOptions()s
 - Peak_View > added method resetVars()
 - Peak_Contoller > added call to postRender() after render(). No more need to explicitly 
   to call it in your application index
 - Peak_View_Render_XXX > fixed a circular problem with render() since render() 
   includes views and views have access to $this->render. The problem came from
   render() behavior and affect all view rendering engines.
   Also Peak_View_RenderInterface deleted and replace by abstract class Peak_View_Render.
   __get() method added and point to Peak_View::__get()
   !IMPORTANT object $view in TEMPLATE will be deprecated in favor of $this.
    ex: $this->my_view_var instead $view->my_view_var
   All view rendering engines needs:
   -render(): - should always authenticate files or throw Peak_Exception if 
                we need the controller script view, otherwise we just skip it
                since content is generated inside this method(JSON engine as
                concrete example).
              - set properties $scripts_file and $script_paths
              - return a valid string or an array() of views filepaths
   -output(): - should be private
              - includes view(s) filepath(s) only OR output render() content result
 - Peak_view > Seperated the logic behind rendering and outputing of views by 
               compartmentalize them into differents render engine               
               Introduce methods engine() and setRenderEngine().
               Long short story, we can control how we render each of our 
               application controllers actions views. For now we have
               Partials, Layouts, Json engines. 

VERSION 0.7.6

 - Peak_View_Theme > renamed method iniOptions() to set setOptions()
 - Peak_View > moved $options, getOptions(), getFunctionsFiles(), iniOptions() to new
   object Peak_View_Theme. We access to Peak_View_Theme methods with Peak_View::theme() 
 - Peak_View > removed useLayout(), noLayout(), getLayoutName(), $layout, $layout_name.
   !IMPORTANT
   View rendering is done by a render engine object ( Peak/View/Render/ ).
   - Method render() point to view engine render().
   - Method engine() added and point to view rendering object
   - Introduced View Engine Partials.php as default view rendering engine.
   Application now view support multiple themes with multiple partials and layouts pages
   Application helpers names have priority over Peak/View/Helpers
 - Peak_Controller > removed property $url_path > deprecated since 
   application dir should be outside public url
 - PROJECT WYNPHP renamed to PEAK Framework
   - all files have been renamed and restructured. The same for classes name
   - wystem folder renamed to peak
   - switch autoload to spl autoload. Classes files and names follow the path scheme like
     zend framework class : Peak_View_Helpers > Peak/View/Helpers.php
                            Peak_View         > Peak/View.php
 - class.registry.php > passed property $registered_objects to static and all method too.
   You can use now every method as static and still able to use the class as singleton
   added method set(), it do the same as register() method.
   register() is deprecated and removed, use set() instead
 - added class.wyn_bootstrap.php > abstract class base for application 
   root bootstrap.php file. Bootstrap are optionnal and will be loaded
   and executed only if file [application_folder]/bootstrap.php exists
 - class.wyn_controller.php > method listActions() > moved $regexp outside the preg_math loop
 - class.wyn_view.php > fixed bug with iniVars() > var with multiples constants 
   were not fully replaced
 - autoload.php > moved top code unrelated to autoload to boot.php.
   boot.php code are for managing critical application configs,
   starting framework and autoloader
   !IMPORTANT: app page changes : load app configs and core/boot.php
   and thats it! you ready to use app object to run your app   
 - Application configs simplified:
   - Only 13 configs now. 3 of them are optionnal.
   - Renamed almost very constants name to more explicit,
     with fewer abbreviations name
 - class.wyn_core.php > removed all $path properties and replaced them by $paths array.
   setPath() now generate constants and no more include core/constants.php
 - class.wyn_controller.php > change visibility to "protected" for property $view 
 - to avoid sessions collusion with multiple application,
   app index.php need to specified a session_name() before session_start
 - class.wyn_controller.php > removed property $wyn, removed $ctrl_type param in _construct,
   and fixed initController() to use router object. 
   Renamed method handleRequest() to handleAction()
   Renamed property $request to $params

VERSION 0.7.5

 - class.registry.php > added method getObjectList()
 - class.wyn.php > !IMPORTANT Replaced route() method by new method run().
   Removed methods getRequestURI(), setRequest(), getRequest() 
   and property $request. They are deprecated with the new router class.  
 - class.router.php > fixed preg_match regex in method getRequestURI()
 - class.wyn_view.php > moved all bottom file functions to functions.wyn_view.php
 - beginning changes that bring class.router.php inside class wyn and wyn_controller.
   In VERSION 0.7.6, changes implied by the new router object will be resolved
 - added simple url rewriting router > class.router.php 
   added router object to the registry in class.wyn.php
   @test unit: tests/router.php
   This new class allows us to use url like /controller/action/param1 and still permitS the use of 
   non-rewrited url like index.php?controller=action&param1
   Requirements Rewriting url: 
      - apache mod_rewrite
      - valid .htaccess that points to application public page @see class.router.php
   !IMPORTANT:
   All routing mechanism will be moved the router object
   class.wyn.php will only handle the route object and in the future will be the
   application launcher object
   This affect : - class.wyn.php methods > route(), 
                                           getRequest(), 
                                           getRequestUri(),
                                           handleInternRequest()
                 - class.wyn_controller > method handleRequest()
 - class.wyn_core.php > fix problem with getPath() not being declared as static method
 - class.wyn_core.php > method getController() > remove dependency 
   to class utils::fileremoveext() 
 - !IMPORTANT Added Registry object class (class.registry.php).  
   We can now store any objects from anywhere and put them somewhere else easily
   - objects wyn_core, wyn_view, lang removed from class.wyn.php :
     $wyn->core, $wyn->view and $wyn->lang objects DON'T exists anymore
   - to get registered object we use : registry::obj->['object registered name']
   - class.wyn.php load registry and store objects wyn_core, wyn_view and lang
   - file affected by change: class.wyn_controller.php, class.wyn_core.php, 
     class.wyn.php, class.viewhelper.php and everywhere we found $wyn->view, $wyn_core, etc
   - fixed class.wyn_view.php bottom functions to use registry instead of global var
   - tests unit file > tests/registry.php
   - current controller object still stored in class.wyn.php (ex: $wyn->controller->name)
 - class.pattern.php > added method range()
 - class.wyn.php > fixed method route() with new core method isModule() and getModule()
 - class.pattern.php > fixed some validation problem with day(), month(), year(), url()
   @see tests/pattern.php
 - create somes tests unit for wyn application start and wyn system classes

VERSION 0.7.4

 - added php tests for wyn with SimpleTest1.0.1 php unit tester
 - class.wyn_view.php > added method getOptions()
 - class.wyn.php > removed unnecessary properties $modules and $controllers, they are already 
   stored in wyn_core object. They are accessible via core methods 
   getModules() and getControllers()
 - class.wyn_core.php > added method getModule()
 - class.wyn_core.php > added exceptions to getControllers() if no controllers exists
 - class.wyn_controller.php > deprecated methods setVar(), getVar(), view()
   view object is now stored in $view
   ex: old way : $this->setVar('varname', $value);
       new way : $this->view->varname = $value;
 - class.wyn.php > renamed getRequest() to setRequest(), added method getRequest() and
   $request visibility changed to protected
 - renamed constants W_LIB_... to W_LIBS_...
 - !MARJOR CHANGES!
   application path and system path complete separation achieved started in 0.7.3:
   - autoloader.php call wyn_core::setPath() if wyn_core class is not loaded
   - removed params $app_path and $sys_path of method getInstance() > class.wyn.php
   - all application and system path vars and constants are generated from class wyn_core.php  
   - application page only needs to include configs.php file and core/autoload.php
   - now we can create unlimited applications with the same wyn system dirs
 - almost all path constant in configs.php have been moved to core/constants.php.
   configs.php is now more short and sweet

VERSION 0.7.3

 - class.wyn_core.php > moved here constants W_VIEWSCRIPTS_ABSPATH,
   W_VIEWINI_ABSPATH, W_CACHE_ABSPATH
 - class.lang.php > fixed a bug in __construct()
 - class.wyn.php > method getInstance() > added $app_path param 
   to propage it to wyn_core->setApplicationPath()
 - class.wyn_core.php > added methods setApplicationPath() and getPath().
   by creating and using those methods, we free the core from configs.php
   some absolute path constants dependencies. 
   For now only applcation, controllers and modules, lang path are supported
   In future, wyn_core will generate absolute path constants contained 
   in configs.php following its own file structure by only specifying an application path.
   No constants will be lost and we will be able to simplify and lighten configs.php
 - class.wyn_core.php > added methods isController() and isModule()
 - class.utils.php > added method objectSort() and objectRSort()
 - class.wyn_view.php > added properties $layout_name and method getLayoutName()
 - class.wyn_core.php > added method getModule() and listCoreClasses()
 - autoload.php > function catch_autoload_err() > added trace file and line
 - renamed core/class.wyn_utils.php to core/class.utils.php
 - added core/class.zreflection.php > Zend_Reflection_Class wrapper. 
   (use libs/zend/reflection/... )

VERSION 0.7.2

 - added core/class.pattern.php > Check different string pattern validation
 - class.wyn_view.php > moved method debug() to view helpers
 - added class.wyn_viewhelper.php > abstract class base for view helper classes,
   it add $view object reference for using inside view helpers 
   to update/change/remove view vars directly
 - class.wyn_controller.php > removed $log stuff and preAction() call moved to handleRequest()
 - class.wyn_controller.php > added postRender() method to fix postAction(). 
   postAction() was called after view rendering and now it is postRender() job.
   postAction() is now called after controller requested action.
 - class.wyn_controller.php > added view() method > return $wyn->view object
 - class.wyn_view.php > method render() > layouts accept now custom file 
   layout with path if file exists
   by default : 
     array('header.php',[CONTENT],'footer.php') 
     => W_TPL_ABSPATH/header.php, etc.
   custom:
     array('header.php','custompath/test.php',[CONTENT],'sidebar.php')
     => W_TPL_ABSPATH/header.php, 'custompath/test.php',etc
 - class.wyn_core.php > method getConfigs() > added $nologin bool param to 
   remove W_LOGIN and W_PASS for array of config
 - class.wyn_core.php > change visibility of var $w_modules and $w_controller to protected

VERSION 0.7.1

 - autoload.php > fixed _autoload() > after checking all class path, 
   if file is not found, it throw a trigger_error()
 - class.wyn.php > removed $this->controller->path overwrite calls in method route() since
   wyn_controller::initController() fix this behavior.
 - class.wyn_controller.php > lightened __construct() and moved code relative 
   to controller object variables initialization into initController() 
   __construct() accept $ctrl_type param as 'module' or 'controller'
 - class.wyn_controller.php > removed setControllerType() method, and removed calls in render()
 - class.wyn_view.php > moved links(),imgs() and cycle() methods to 
   functions.wyn_view.php wich is included in class.wyn_view.php
 - wyn.php, class.wyn_view.php > load theme 'functions.php',if file exists, before view print
   @see wyn_view > getFunctionsFile()
 - autoload.php > fixed a problem with ZEND_LIB_ABSPATH, and added internal zend library
   since wynphp will use zend reflection classes, it make sense to have the strict minimun:
   zend/reflection/ and zend/loader/ internally.
   __autoload() now check in first place if zend class needed exists in wsystem/libs/zend, 
   otherwise it checkS in W_ZENDLIB_ABSPATH (external zend library) if this config exists.
   and finally if the file is not found, it throw a trigger_error. 
 - class.wyn_view.php > $theme renamed to $options and iniTheme() 
   renamed to iniOptions()
   theme.ini arrays loaded into $options if file found.
   fixed useLayout() to accept strings that points to $options['layouts'][layout string]
 - added ZEND_LIB_ABSPATH in configs.php and modified autoload.php.
   We can use now Zend framework Library
   This setting is not essential, if this constant is not found, autoload
   will simply ignore it. 
 - class.wyn_core.php > added method getLang()

VERSION 0.7.0

 - added great shorcut functions in class.wyn_view.php for view object:
   view(), view_hlp(), view_get(), view_echo().
   ex: "echo view()->myvar" =  "view_echo('myvar')" = "echo $wyn->view->myvar"
       "view_hlp('text')->truncate($txt,10)" =
       "$wyn->view->heler('text')->truncate($txt,10)"
 - class.wyn_view.php > removed method handleRenderError(), 
   no more needed with class.wyn_exception.php
 - class.wyn_controller.php > fixed a bug with handleRequest().
   when _index() method doesn't exists, we throw a exception 
   instead of letting the controller trying to call an inexistant method
 - added layout possiblities in class.wyn_view.php, wyn.php. 
   See method useLayout() and noLayout() in wyn_view class for more info
   Folder 'theme' will be the 'pseudo layouts' folder and all others
   controller scripts views files have been moved in their respective view scripts folders
   /wsystem/view/scripts/[ctrl_name]/[action_name].php
   One big adavantage of this is to get rid of all thoses
   <?php include(W_TPL_ABASPATH.'/[header|footer|...].php'); ?> 
   in every controller views and modules views files 
   For example: we create a new controller called 'imanewctrl' so
   controller class = /wsystem/controllers/imanewctrl.php
   controller view default = /wsystem/view/scripts/imanewctrl/index.php
   Method action name in the controller are used for view file name
   ex: imanewctrl.php > action method = _myaction() 
       view file = /wsystem/view/scripts/imanewctrl/myaction.php 
 - class.wyn_controller.php > added function setControllerType() and variable $type.
   modified action name by default to _index instead of _default
 - added view helper text.php with miscellenous functions taken form smarty modifier
   view/helpers/text.php codes from http://smarty.net modifiers
 - updated class.xml.php > support of file_get_content and curl(usefull when 'allow_furl_open' is desactivated)
 - autoload.php > added catch_autoload_err() function.
   if the class name is not found in loaded file class
   we throw a custom error instead of letting php standard error handler.
   Support 'DEV_MODE'
 - wyn.php > exceptions point now to wexception controller
 - class.wyn.php > route() : modules and controller are now verified and throw wyn_exception if failed
 - added /core/class.wyn_exception.php

VERSION 0.6.9

 - class.wyn_controller.php > moved checkAlert() to wyn_core class 
   and renamed it checkConfigs()
 - class.wyn_controller.php > moved handleRenderError() to wyn_view class
 - class.wyn_controller.php >
   most of render() code copied to wyn_view, 
   but we still call the controller render() method basicly for controller 
   pre-render stuff and we let wyn_view class do what it suppose to do: 
   deal with template file verification and stuff like that.
 - class.wyn.php > $tpl object name renamed to $view.
   Important: use $this->wyn->view->[..] or $wyn->wyn->view->[..] in 
   controller and template. Quick var $tpl->[..] is style available in template 
   but no longrt since i renamed $tpl object to $view.
 - class.wyn_router.php > $module renamed to $controller
 - moved /wsystem/core/view/ folder to /wsystem/view/ 
 - fixed wyn_core.php: getControllers() > controllers were not properly cached into session
 - moved all action methods unrelated inside dashboard to controllers classes folder
 - added controllers heleprs /wsystem/controllers/helpers/
   class.wyn_controller.php > added helper() method
   ex: $this->helper('myCtrlHelper')->myfunc();
 - fix class.wyn_controller.php > render() to support wyn controllers folder
   render priority : wdashboard controller, [controller], [modules]

VERSION 0.6.8

 - fix autoload.php: added controllers class detection
 - added /controllers/ folders and move all controllers in /core/ there.
 - added view ini for preloading template variables(default.ini)
 - configs.php: added constants W_VIEWHELPERS_ROOT, W_VIEWINI_ROOT, W_VIEWHELPERS_ABSPATH, 
   W_VIEWINI_ABSPATH
 - fix class wlang problem in wyn.php and class.wyn.php. 
   The class was runned twice and not properly encapsulated in router class.wyn.php 
 - tweaked wyn_view.php: helper() > Syntax accepted now in template:
   $tpl->helper('myhelper')->myfunc(); //load helper and call func
   $tpl->helper()->myhelper->myfunc(); //only call already loaded helper func
 - dashboard class > added some infos on current apache 
 - param 'php_ext' added in moduled ini file. 
   Each module ini can now specify requires php extension(s) to run properly.
 - param 'descr' added in moduled ini file.
 - fix problem with debug window still available on login page
 - default template file of controller action method is view.[method].php 
   if $file is not specified
 - dashboard -> added 'about' action

VERSION 0.6.7

 - added view helpers. They are stored in core/helpers/view.[title].php
   ex:  view.calendar.php  - $tpl->helper('calendar');
 - wyn controller (class.intro.php) name renamed to dashboard(class.dashboard.php)
 - default controller action method name is now '_defaut' instead '_intro'
